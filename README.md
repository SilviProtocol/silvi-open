# Agentic-ETH-Hackathon---Treekipedia-

## DeepTrees: AI-Agentic Research & NFTrees 🌱🚀  
**Built for ETHGlobal’s "Agentic Ethereum" Hackathon**

---

## 🌍 Project Vision  
DeepTrees is an **AI-driven, agent-centric Web3 project** that automates the **discovery, validation, and enrichment of scientific knowledge on tree species**.  
It integrates AI agents with Web3 to create **dynamically evolving NFTs ("NFTrees")**, funding continuous ecological research.

---

## 🔬 How It Works
1️⃣ **Users search for a tree species** via the front-end.  
2️⃣ If data **exists**, they can mint an **NFTree**, linked to evolving research.  
3️⃣ If **no research exists**, users can **trigger an AI research agent** by funding knowledge discovery.  
4️⃣ AI agents **gather, validate, and store data** on-chain and in Treekipedia.  
5️⃣ NFTrees dynamically **update their metadata** as new research is verified.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies  
- **AI Agents** → AgentKit automates tree species research & verification  
- **Knowledge Graph** → Blazegraph stores validated scientific research  
- **NFTrees** → Dynamic NFTs linked to **on-chain research data**  
- **Base L2** → Cost-efficient Ethereum L2 for smart contracts & attestations  
- **PostgreSQL** → Stores structured AI-generated research before merging into Treekipedia  
- **React + OnchainKit** → Frontend for search, minting, and research tracking
