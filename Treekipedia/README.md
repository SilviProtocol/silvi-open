# 🌳 Treekipedia

## About
Treekipedia is an open-source initiative to create a comprehensive, scalable database of tree-related knowledge. Our mission is to unify fragmented datasets into a single, accessible resource serving researchers, educators, and practitioners in agroforestry and related fields.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Create a unified taxonomy and species list as the foundation for an extensive tree knowledge graph
- Develop a structured ontology for organizing tree-related data
- Integrate data from multiple authoritative sources
- Provide an open, accessible platform for the global tree knowledge community

## 🚀 Current Progress
- ✅ Hired a post-doctorate ecologist
- ✅ Developed prototype taxonomic schema
- ✅ Established data retrieval and filtering strategy using R Studio
- ✅ Identified and compiled 10+ source species databases
- ✅ Set up GraphDB/BlazeGraph for data storage

## 📊 Data Sources
We integrate data from several authoritative sources:
- GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
- iNaturalist
- Wikidata
- World Flora Online (WFO)
- BGCI
- And more...

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Data Processing:** R Studio
- **Data Storage:** GraphDB/BlazeGraph
- **Data Format:** RDF (Resource Description Framework)
- **Query Language:** SPARQL
- **Database Type:** Graph Database

## 📝 Key Features
1. **Structured Ontology**
   - Hierarchical classification of tree data
   - Defined relationships between different data elements
   - Machine-readable format using RDF

2. **Comprehensive Data Coverage**
   - Species information
   - Geographic occurrences
   - Habitat information
   - Taxonomic data
   - Bioregional aptitude

3. **Data Management**
   - Large-scale data retrieval capabilities
   - Filtered specifically for tree-related data
   - Regular updates and maintenance

4. **Silvi Integration**([1](https://docs.silvi.earth/silvi-app-user-guide/connecting-a-wallet))
   - Direct connection with Silvi application for tree planting verification
   - Support for Celo-compatible wallet integration
   - Automated data validation through the Silvi platform
   - Real-world tree planting data collection
   - Integration with community-driven validation systems

## 🗺️ Roadmap
### In Progress
- Finalizing species and occurrence data compilation
