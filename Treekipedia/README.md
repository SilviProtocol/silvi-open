# üå≥ Treekipedia

## About
Treekipedia is an open-source, AI-enhanced, Web3-integrated initiative to create a comprehensive, scalable, and decentralized database of tree-related knowledge. Our mission is to unify fragmented ecological datasets‚Äîspanning scientific, institutional, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)‚Äîinto a single, accessible, and interoperable resource serving researchers, conservationists, educators, and practitioners in agroforestry, reforestation, and related fields. By leveraging AI-driven autonomous agents, blockchain technology, and decentralized storage, Treekipedia addresses data fragmentation, enhances scalability, and ensures the integrity and transparency of global biodiversity and reforestation efforts.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Create a unified taxonomy and species list as the foundation for an extensive tree knowledge graph, enhanced by AI-driven structuring and predictive analytics.
- Develop a structured ontology for organizing tree-related data, linking ecological attributes, climate resilience, and species interactions using a machine-readable format (RDF).
- Integrate data from multiple authoritative sources, including scientific archives, community inputs, and geospatial datasets, using AI and natural language processing (NLP).
- Provide an open, accessible, and decentralized platform for the global tree knowledge community, supported by blockchain-verified data provenance and NFT-based incentives.

## üöÄ Current Progress
- ‚úÖ Hired a post-doctorate ecologist to lead ecological data integration.
- ‚úÖ Developed a prototype taxonomic schema, now enhanced with AI-driven ontology structuring.
- ‚úÖ Established data retrieval and filtering strategies using R Studio, integrated with AI Research Agents for automated data extraction and validation.
- ‚úÖ Identified and compiled over 10+ source species databases (e.g., GBIF, iNaturalist, Wikidata, World Flora Online) and incorporated Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).
- ‚úÖ Set up GraphDB/BlazeGraph for decentralized data storage, with plans to expand to IPFS for permanence and accessibility.

## üìä Data Sources
We integrate data from diverse authoritative sources to create a comprehensive ecological intelligence framework:
- GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
- iNaturalist
- Wikidata
- World Flora Online (WFO)
- BGCI
- Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) from grassroots and indigenous communities
- Geospatial datasets, multispectral satellite imagery, and sensor-based monitoring for real-time ecological insights
- And more...

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
- **Data Processing:** R Studio, AI Research Agents with NLP and knowledge graph analysis
- **Data Storage:** GraphDB/BlazeGraph, decentralized storage via IPFS
- **Data Format:** RDF (Resource Description Framework) for machine-readable interoperability
- **Query Language:** SPARQL for querying the graph database
- **Database Type:** Graph Database, scalable for large-scale ecological datasets
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for data authenticity, NFTrees (ERC-1155) and Contreebution NFTs (ERC-721) for incentives and validation

## üìù Key Features & Innovations
1. **AI-Driven Data Acquisition & Structuring**
   - AI Research Agents autonomously extract, standardize, and validate tree species data from peer-reviewed literature, research archives, and community inputs using NLP and knowledge graphs.
   - Predictive analytics with remote sensing (geospatial datasets, multispectral imaging) and reinforcement learning refine ecological modeling, forecasting tree survival, biodiversity impacts, and ecosystem resilience.
   - Agentic Peer Review Framework: AI-generated insights undergo expert and community-driven validation, ensuring credibility and reliability.

2. **Blockchain & Web3 Integration**
   - Decentralized storage on IPFS ensures data permanence and prevents centralization bottlenecks.
   - Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) validates ecological data authenticity on-chain, reinforcing scientific credibility and immutability.
   - NFT-Based Incentive Structures:
     - **Species NFTs (NFTrees - ERC-1155)**: Dynamic, evolving representations of tree species knowledge that update with new data, serving as living knowledge artifacts.
     - **Contreebution NFTs (ERC-721)**: Awarded to contributors for research, peer reviews, or data validation, tracking individual contributions and incentivizing long-term engagement.
   - Interoperable APIs enable seamless integration with reforestation tools, biodiversity databases, and natural capital frameworks.

3. **Comprehensive Data Coverage**
   - Species information, geographic occurrences, habitat data, taxonomic details, and bioregional aptitude, enhanced by AI-driven synthesis.
   - Integration of TEK and scientific datasets for an equity-centered ecological intelligence framework.

4. **Data Management**
   - Large-scale, AI-powered data retrieval capabilities, filtered specifically for tree-related data.
   - Regular updates and maintenance, supported by decentralized governance and blockchain-verified provenance.
   - Geospatial and remote sensing integration for real-time monitoring of deforestation, afforestation, and biodiversity restoration.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Development Trajectory
### Phase 1: Post-Hackathon & MVP Launch
- Resolve technical debt (e.g., frontend API issues, TaxonID integration, EAS schema implementation).
- Launch DeepTrees MVP for public testing (50-200 users, stretch goal: 1,000 users), monitoring stability and gathering feedback.
- Mint over 100 Contreebution NFTs and plan the ‚ÄòIconic Species Collection‚Äô NFT auction (Genesis 100 trees).

### Phase 2: Refinement & Infrastructure Consolidation
- Optimize GraphDB/BlazeGraph and DeepTrees VM deployments for large datasets (>8GB occurrences).
- Implement data versioning and natural language SPARQL queries.
- Design a multi-step verification process for AI-generated data, including human review and community governance.

### Phase 3: Community Engagement & Governance Development
- Outreach to scientists, foresters, and ReFi organizations for partnerships.
- Establish Treekipedia Working Groups for ongoing validation and user contributions.
- Refine NFT-based incentives and launch the DeepTrees Iconic Species Collection, with community governance modeled on Wikipedia or DAOs.

### Phase 4: Scaling AI Research & Decentralized Validation
- Optimize AI retrieval and structuring algorithms for taxonomic and ecological data expansion.
- Build a peer-reviewed validation pipeline with weighted community governance and expanded EAS usage.
- Develop a data credibility scoring system for AI-generated research.

### Phase 5: Full-Scale Public Rollout & Silvi Integration
- Finalize Treekipedia APIs for broad use, connecting with Silvi for MRV and tree steward support.
- Launch a refined frontend with DeepTrees + Treekipedia integration, deploying advanced ecological models for carbon and biodiversity impact tracking.
- Scale to global partnerships with reforestation projects and biodiversity platforms, establishing Treekipedia as a global standard for ecological intelligence.
