# Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) Integration

This folder will contain the code and documentation for integrating the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) into the DeepTrees project.

## Overview

The EAS integration will handle:
- **On-Chain Attestations:** Validating AI-researched species data on-chain.
- **NFTree Minting:** Linking attested research data to NFTree tokens.
- **Smart Contract Interactions:** Managing low-cost transactions on Base L2.
- **Workflow Integration:** Connecting the EAS processes with our AI agent and PostgreSQL storage.

## Next Steps

- Develop smart contracts (ERC-721) for dynamic NFTree minting.
- Implement API endpoints to trigger EAS attestations.
- Integrate on-chain verification into the DeepTrees backend.
- Document deployment procedures and testing on Base L2.

This is an initial placeholder. Future commits will add detailed implementation and configuration scripts.
