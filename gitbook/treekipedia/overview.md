# Overview

## What is Treekipedia?

Treekipedia is an open source, comprehensive database of tree knowledge.

Treekipedia is a collaborative initiative dedicated to empowering individuals and communities worldwide to contribute to and benefit from a collective understanding of trees. Our mission is to create an open-access, community-driven platform modeled after Wikipedia, that supports tree stewardship, biodiversity research, reforestation efforts, and public education.


## Our Approach

The foundation and initial release of Treekipedia will be a consolidation & filtering of existing and fragmented global species datasets into one comprehensive, tree focused, database which will form the basis of the tree intelligence ontology and knowledge graph.

This ontology and tree knowledge graph will form the structure of the open Treekipedia platform with tree species pages that include key characteristics, images, stewardship best practices, ecological modeling methods, geographic occurrences, bioregional aptitude, and more.

## Why it Matters


Through collaboration and the integration of data from citizen science, institutional collections, and existing biodiversity databases, TreeKipedia serves as a unified source of tree knowledge. This database will be open source and accessible to anyone working to foster global reforestation efforts.&#x20;
