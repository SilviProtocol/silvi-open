# Registering a Tree

## Tree Types Explained

**New Planting:** This type of tree should be registered with Silvi immediately after planting.&#x20;

**Young Tree:** A young tree is a tree that has been recently planted and has not yet reached maturity.&#x20;

**Mature Tree:** A mature tree can be registered for biodiversity monitoring or to register a Mother Tree which produces seeds and seedlings that can be planted in order to produce seedlings/saplings.&#x20;

If a green confirmation banner appears, **your tree was registered.** Now it is visible and can be interacted with on the map.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to **change the location of a tree** or if you have **uploaded it by mistake,** you should contact your administrator.

Trees are marked on the map with green icons. When the globe is zoomed out they are grouped, counted, and marked with larger green circles.
