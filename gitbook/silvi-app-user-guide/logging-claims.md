# Logging Claims

## What is a claim?

**A claim is the process of uploading images and information to the Silvi App in order to produce a proof for an event.**&#x20;

Claims can be configured to send/receive payouts. The information in the claim, and the methodology that it is fulfilling will determine the payout.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Claims can be made on any registered asset and methodologies/payouts are not required.
{% endhint %}

There are two types of claims:

### Registration Claim

A registration claim is a _genesis claim_ when you register an asset on the map page for the first time. It can also be used to define environment types such as seed beds, potted beds or reforestation sites.&#x20;

### Post-Registration Claim

A post registration claim is filed on an asset that has already been registered - **think of it as an update on the asset.** The information in the claim, and the methodology that it is fulfilling will determine the payout for the follow-up events such as proof of maturity etc



## Logging a Claim on an Asset

1. Show up to the asset in-person with the Silvi app
2. **Click** on an `asset` in the map page.&#x20;
3. Make sure it is the right asset, and click `log claim.`&#x20;
4. **Choose** the `type` of claim you would like to make and follow the instructions.
