The plant *Tabernaemontana pandacaqui*, commonly known as the Banana Bush, is characterized by the following morphological features:

## **General Characteristics**
- **Growth Form**: It can grow as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights up to 14 meters in optimum conditions, though cultivated plants frequently grow smaller, about 1 to 4 meters[1][6][7].
- **Deciduous or Evergreen**: It is an evergreen species, retaining leaves year-round[5][7].
- **Lifespan**: This species is perennial but specific maximum age data is not explicitly available, though it is known to be long-lived.

## **Leaves**
- **Type**: Opposite, simple leaves.
- **Shape**: Elliptic, obovate, or oblanceolate.
- **Size**: Leaf blades typically measure 3–14 cm long and 1–6.5 cm wide, with some variations[2][3][10].
- **Texture**: Papery or semi-glossy, glabrous or with occasional sparse pubescence.
- **Veins**: Pinnately veined, with prominent lateral veins.
- **Petioles**: About 0.5–1.5 cm long[1][10].

## **Flowers**
- **Color**: White with pale yellow or lemon-yellow throats.
- **Shape**: Corolla is twisted or spiraled with 5 lobes, sometimes flounced or asymmetrical.
- **Size**: Corolla tube measures 9–17 mm long; lobes measure 5–15 mm long[3][10].
- **Scent**: Flowers are fragrant, though weakly so in some specimens[1][7].
- **Blooming Period**: Flowers typically bloom from early September through to early March[3].

## **Fruits**
- **Type**: The fruit consists of paired follicles.
- **Color**: They start as lime-green but turn bright orange, red, or yellow as they ripen.
- **Size**: Follicles range from 0.9–7.1 cm long and 0.5–3 cm wide[1][4].
- **Seeds**: Encased in a red or orange aril, the seeds are black and spherical, measuring approximately 4–6 mm in length[1][3].

## **Bark and Latex**
- **Bark Characteristics**: The bark is pale gray on mature stems and releases a milky latex when cut or damaged[3][10].
- **Lenticels**: Branchlets have light-colored lenticels that are conspicuous and circular[1][10].

## **Dimensions**
- **Maximum Height**: Up to 14 meters, but often smaller in cultivation.
- **Maximum Diameter**: Spread of 2.5 meters is common[6].

## **Habitat and Adaptations**
- Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands.
- Tolerates a variety of soils, with a preference for sandy loams to medium clays rich in organic matter. It can withstand short periods of waterlogging but thrives in well-drained soils[3][7].
- Common in rainforests, beach forests, and monsoon forests, from sea level to altitudes of 800 meters[10].

This species is appreciated for its ornamental value, with showy flowers and bright fruits, though its fruits are toxic to humans.
