  "taxon_id": "AngMaMyMy17742-00",
  "species_scientific_name": "Eucalyptus quinniorum",
  "researched": true,
  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "General eucalyptus stewardship includes planting in well-draining soils, ensuring adequate spacing for air circulation, and avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Pruning is best done in spring or early summer, and reducing stand density can help manage fire risks.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Plant in well-draining sandy or loamy soils with a pH of 6.0–7.5. Young plants should be watered frequently until established, after which they become drought-tolerant. Spacing should allow for proper air circulation.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Prune in spring or early summer to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. Avoid pruning in late autumn or winter to prevent frost damage.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Monitor soil health to avoid nutrient depletion and manage potential allelopathic effects.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Reduce stand density to lower fire hazards. Controlled burns may be used strategically to manage undergrowth and litter.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Well-draining, sandy or loamy soils with pH 6.0–7.5.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "Indigenous communities may have cultural and ecological knowledge tied to eucalypts, emphasizing sustainable use and long-term stewardship.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "While specific conservation status for Eucalyptus quinniorum is not documented, many eucalypts face threats from habitat destruction and climate change.",
  "general_description_ai": "Eucalyptus quinniorum, commonly known as Quinni's eucalyptus or monkey gum, is a mallee or small to medium-sized tree with multiple trunks. It is native to northern New South Wales.",
  "habitat_ai": "Grows in low woodlands, ridges, and among granite boulders in disjunct populations in northern New South Wales.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": null,
  "ecological_function_ai": "Provides habitat for wildlife, is resilient to drought, and plays a role in fire-adapted ecosystems.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Native to Australia, specifically northern New South Wales, adapted to thrive in well-draining soils and withstand drought conditions.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Can be used in agroforestry systems as windbreaks, shade for livestock, and timber production.",
  "growth_form_ai": "Predominantly grows as a mallee with 5–12 trunks, or sometimes as a small to medium-sized tree.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Juvenile leaves are broad-lanceolate to ovate and glossy green; adult leaves are linear to narrow-lanceolate, slightly curved, and glossy dark green.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen",
  "flower_color_ai": "White",
  "fruit_type_ai": "Woody capsule, hemispherical to cylindrical with 2–4 ribs, often splitting on one side.",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "Smooth white bark with grey blotches, shedding in long ribbons, and a short, persistent stringy bark near the trunk base.",
  "maximum_height_ai": 16,
  "maximum_diameter_ai": null,
  "lifespan_ai": "Eucalypts, especially mallees, can persist for several decades to centuries through regenerative capabilities.",
  "maximum_tree_age_ai": null,
