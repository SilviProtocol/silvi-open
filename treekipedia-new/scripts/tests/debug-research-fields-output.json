  "taxon_id": "AngNAParc36603-00",
  "species_scientific_name": "Phoenix dactylifera",
  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Date palms prefer full sun (minimum six hours of direct light per day) and well-drained soils. Sandy or loamy soils are ideal, and they tolerate a wide pH range and moderate salinity. Young trees need regular, deep watering, while established palms are drought-tolerant. Prune only to remove dead or broken fronds and avoid over-pruning. Remove dry, dead fronds to reduce fire risk.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball and slightly shallower than its depth. Amend native soil with compost if organic matter is low, ensuring drainage is not impeded. Plant so the root crown sits just above soil level. Backfill and gently tamp soil, then water thoroughly. Mulch with 3 inches of organic matter, keeping mulch a few inches away from the trunk.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Prune only to remove dead, yellow, or broken fronds. Remove flower and fruit stalks if fruit production is not desired. Remove suckers at the base to focus energy on the main trunk. Best time to prune is late spring or early summer.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Avoid trunk wounds to prevent infection by Fusarium or Thielaviopsis fungi. Maintain good sanitation by removing fallen fronds and fruit. Monitor for scale insects, mites, mealybugs, and fungal pathogens. Overwatering and poor drainage are primary contributors to root rot and fungal diseases.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Date palms are not highly flammable due to their high moisture fronds. Regular removal of dry, dead fronds and fruit stalks reduces fire risk, especially near structures or in wildland-urban interfaces.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Sandy, loamy, and saline/sandy soils are suitable. Poor drainage is not recommended.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "Dates are a staple food in Middle Eastern and North African diets, with immense historical, religious, and economic significance. Featured in religious texts and traditional celebrations. Date palms symbolize hospitality and life in arid lands.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Phoenix dactylifera is not currently endangered due to extensive cultivation worldwide. Some wild relatives and genetic diversity are at risk due to habitat loss and over-reliance on a narrow genetic base.",
  "general_description_ai": "Phoenix dactylifera, the Date Palm, is a large, single-trunked palm renowned for its edible fruit. Native to the Middle East and North Africa, it has been cultivated for millennia and can reach heights of up to 23 meters.",
  "habitat_ai": "Date Palms thrive in arid environments with hot, dry summers and are highly adapted to desert oases.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": "Naturally occurs from sea level up to 1,500 meters.",
  "ecological_function_ai": "Provides significant shade and microhabitat in desert environments. Offers food and shelter for a wide range of fauna. Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Well adapted to desert, semi-desert, and oasis habitats, including riparian zones and cultivated lands in arid regions.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Widely used in oasis agriculture: provides shade for understory crops and windbreaks for other plants. Integrates into polyculture systems, supporting crops that benefit from its shade and microclimate.",
  "growth_form_ai": "Single-trunked, upright, columnar palm.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Pinnate (feather-like), with spiny petiole, about 5 meters long.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen",
  "flower_color_ai": "Creamy-white to yellowish",
  "fruit_type_ai": "Drupe (date), one-seeded, oblong.",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "Rough, brown, marked with diamond-shaped pattern left by pruned stubs of old leaf bases.",
  "maximum_height_ai": 23,
