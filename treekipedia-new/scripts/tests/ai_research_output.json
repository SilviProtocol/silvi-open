  "taxon_id": "AngMaFaFb0001-00",
  "species_scientific_name": "Abarema cochliocarpos",
  "researched": true,
  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Habitat Protection: Safeguard natural habitats and prioritize areas with high genetic diversity for in-situ conservation. Ex-Situ Conservation: Establish seed banks and cultivate in botanical gardens for genetic preservation. Restoration Projects: Integrate into reforestation projects in its native ecosystems, especially in degraded forests or Caatinga areas, to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Community Engagement: Promote awareness of its cultural and ecological importance among local communities to prevent overharvesting.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Soil: Abarema cochliocarpos prefers sandy, well-drained soils, particularly in coastal zones. Inland forms can tolerate less fertile and more compact soils found in arid savanna. Propagation: The species can be propagated by seeds, which must be pretreated (likely through scarification to aid germination). Plant in holes with compost-enriched soil to enhance establishment in degraded areas.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Conduct pruning to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches. Pruning should ideally be done during the tree's dormant phase to minimize stress. In agroforestry systems, pruning may also enhance access to light for understory crops.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "There is limited specific information on pests and diseases affecting Abarema cochliocarpos. General Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices can apply: Cultural practices: Start with healthy plants, manage irrigation, and maintain good soil drainage. Manual methods: Remove infected plant parts promptly. Chemical control: Use target-specific fungicides or pesticides as a last resort to prevent harm to non-target organisms.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Given its occurrence in fire-prone savanna habitats, this species might exhibit some resilience to low-intensity fires. Protect young plants and incorporate firebreaks to manage fire risks in plantations or conservation areas.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Sandy, well-drained soils for coastal forms; less fertile, compact soils for inland forms.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "The plant holds significant medicinal value in Brazilian traditional medicine. Extracts from its bark are known for their antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and pain-relieving properties. They are commonly used to treat wounds and infections.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Vulnerable due to threats like habitat loss from agriculture and iron mining.",
  "general_description_ai": "Abarema cochliocarpos, commonly known as barbatimão, is a small tree or shrub in the Fabaceae family. It grows up to 8 meters tall and is endemic to Brazil. Its common habitats include the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Caatinga vegetation. The species has two forms: a coastal form that can exceed 10 meters in height and thrives on sandy substrates, and an inland form, shorter (up to 4 meters), which adapts to savanna, scrub, and disturbed habitats with tougher leaflets.",
  "habitat_ai": "Coastal form: Sandy woodland habitats. Inland form: Scrublands, savanna, and disturbed regions.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": "Adaptable to lowland and upland conditions in its respective coastal and inland environments.",
  "ecological_function_ai": "This species plays a role as a native plant in stabilizing soils and supporting biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest and Caatinga regions. Its bark and roots likely influence soil nutrients and microbial activity.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Native to Brazil, its distribution spans areas such as Alagoas, Bahia, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, and São Paulo.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "A shade tree in agroforestry systems, particularly in arid or savanna-like environments. An erosion-control species, stabilizing soils with its root systems in degraded land restoration projects. Providing medicinal resources through sustainable harvesting of bark.",
  "growth_form_ai": "Occurs in two forms: a coastal form that can exceed 10 meters in height and an inland form up to 4 meters in height.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Compound leaves.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen.",
  "flower_color_ai": "Small and white.",
  "fruit_type_ai": "Pods containing seeds.",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "High tannin content and therapeutic properties (e.g., as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory).",
  "maximum_height_ai": 10,
  "maximum_diameter_ai": null,
  "lifespan_ai": "Long-lived, often persisting for decades.",
