### Ecological and Practical Stewardship Information for *Abarema cochliocarpos*

#### **General Description**
Abarema cochliocarpos, commonly known as "barbatimão," is a small- to medium-sized tree in the Fabaceae family. It grows up to 8 meters tall and is native to the eastern regions of Brazil. This species varies in form depending on its habitat, with inland forms typically shorter (around 4 meters) and tougher, while coastal forms can exceed 10 meters in height[2][5]. 

The bark is traditionally used in Brazilian medicine as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and for wound treatment[5].

- Found in Brazil, in regions such as Alagoas, Bahia, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, and São Paulo[5].
- Grows in diverse habitats such as the Atlantic Forest, Caatinga (semi-arid scrubland), coastal woodlands, and savanna-like areas on sandy or disturbed soils[1][5][10].

#### **Elevation Range**
The specific elevation range is not documented but aligns with the distribution in seasonally dry tropical biomes and coastal regions[10].

#### **Ecological Function**
- Plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in coastal regions.
- Provides resources for native fauna, including food and habitat.
- Utilized in agroforestry systems to promote biodiversity and sustainable land management[10].

### **Practical Stewardship Information**

#### **Planting and Soil Requirements**
- Prefers sandy or well-drained soils, making it adaptable to degraded areas or regions prone to erosion.
- Thrives in both disturbed and undisturbed landscapes, showing resilience in semi-arid and dry tropical climates[5][10].
- Planting should be done in areas that mimic its native conditions, ensuring adequate sunlight and protection from fire hazards.

#### **Pruning and Maintenance**
- Pruning may involve removing dead or diseased branches to enhance overall plant health. Root pruning might be conducted in early spring (February/March) to control growth in urban or contained environments[9].
- Shade management is advised to optimize growth and prevent pest problems[4].

#### **Disease and Pest Management**
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies are recommended:
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases.
- Use of biological controls, such as encouraging natural predators, and minimizing chemical pesticide use[7].
- If fungal diseases occur, applying a copper-based fungicide like Bordeaux mixture can be effective[4].

#### **Fire Management**
The species may face threats from wildfires. To mitigate fire risks:
- Employ firebreaks around planting areas.
- Maintain minimal underbrush and remove debris that could fuel fires.
