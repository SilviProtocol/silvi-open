  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Stewardship practices should prioritize habitat restoration, sustainable harvesting, and protection from environmental threats. Its adaptability to dry tropical climates and sandy soils makes it a valuable species for land restoration and agroforestry use in Brazil.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Planting should be done in areas that mimic its native conditions, ensuring adequate sunlight and protection from fire hazards. Prefers sandy or well-drained soils.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Pruning may involve removing dead or diseased branches to enhance overall plant health. Root pruning might be conducted in early spring to control growth in urban or contained environments. Shade management is advised to optimize growth and prevent pest problems.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies are recommended. Regular monitoring for pests and diseases, use of biological controls, and minimizing chemical pesticide use are advised. If fungal diseases occur, applying a copper-based fungicide like Bordeaux mixture can be effective.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Employ firebreaks around planting areas. Maintain minimal underbrush and remove debris that could fuel fires.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Sandy or well-drained soils.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "Valued in Brazilian traditional medicine for its bark, which has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Known for its use in wound healing and pain relief.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Classified as 'Vulnerable' due to habitat loss from agricultural expansion and mining activities. Benefits from protection in several Brazilian conservation areas.",
  "general_description_ai": "Abarema cochliocarpos, commonly known as 'barbatimão', is a small- to medium-sized tree in the Fabaceae family, native to the eastern regions of Brazil. It is valued for its medicinal properties and adaptability to various environments.",
  "habitat_ai": "Found in Brazil in regions such as Alagoas, Bahia, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, and São Paulo. Grows in diverse habitats such as the Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, coastal woodlands, and savanna-like areas.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": null,
  "ecological_function_ai": "Plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in coastal regions. Provides resources for native fauna, including food and habitat. Utilized in agroforestry systems to promote biodiversity and sustainable land management.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, coastal woodlands, and savanna-like areas.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Suitable for agroforestry systems where it can stabilize soils and enhance biodiversity. Its medicinal value may offer opportunities for sustainable harvesting and economic benefit for local communities.",
  "growth_form_ai": "The tree displays two forms based on habitat: coastal form can exceed 10 meters in height, inland form grows up to 4 meters.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Pinnately compound leaves characteristic of the Fabaceae family.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen.",
  "flower_color_ai": "White.",
  "fruit_type_ai": "Produces pods containing multiple seeds.",
