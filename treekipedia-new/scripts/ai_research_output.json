  "taxon_id": "AngMaGepc46774-00",
  "species_scientific_name": "Tabernaemontana pandacaqui",
  "researched": true,
  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Through proper planting, maintenance, and pest management practices, Tabernaemontana pandacaqui can be a resilient and attractive addition to diverse habitats.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Propagate through seeds or cuttings. Fresh seeds germinate in 2â€“3 weeks when sown just under the soil surface in a light, airy potting mix. For cuttings, use semi-hardwood stems from the current season and plant in a soilless potting mix. Ideal planting seasons are spring, summer, or autumn, ensuring moist but not waterlogged soil conditions.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Prune regularly to shape the plant and encourage bushier growth. Remove dead or diseased branches as needed. Fertilize every two months during the establishment phase and twice annually with organic fertilizers like seaweed or fish emulsion.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Monitor for infestations of pests like aphids and mealybugs, and apply natural pest controls such as neem oil or insecticidal soap as needed. Ensure good air circulation around plants to prevent fungal issues.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Fire resilience was not specifically mentioned, but its role in tropical understories suggests it thrives in low-fire regimes typical of rainforests.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils with a pH range of 6 to 7.5. A sandy loam mix enhanced with organic matter such as compost or perlite is ideal.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "In traditional medicine, the root bark has been used for tropical fevers, and the fruit for treating sores. Its fragrant flowers are significant in ceremonial applications in some cultures. Note that all parts of the plant contain alkaloids and should be used with caution.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Not listed as threatened, widely distributed and cultivated as an ornamental plant, ensuring population stability in managed settings.",
  "general_description_ai": "Tabernaemontana pandacaqui, also known as the banana bush or windmill bush, is a small shrub or tree in the dogbane family, reaching up to 14 meters in height. It is known for its glossy, lanceolate leaves and fragrant, star-shaped flowers with white or cream-colored petals. The plant produces paired, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or orange when ripe.",
  "habitat_ai": "Thrives in a variety of settings, including rainforest understories, monsoon forests, and coastal forests. It grows well in drier tropical zones, up to elevations of 800 meters.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": "Sea level to 800 meters.",
  "ecological_function_ai": "Plays an important role in tropical ecosystems as an understory plant. Its flowers attract pollinators, and its fruits serve as a food source for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Contributes to soil stabilization in forested areas.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Native to Southeast Asia, Australia, the Pacific Islands, and portions of China and Taiwan. Naturalized in the Windward Islands and other tropical areas.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Suitable as a companion plant in agroforestry systems due to its adaptability to understory conditions. Helps maintain biodiversity by supporting pollinators and seed dispersers.",
  "growth_form_ai": "It grows either as a shrub or a small tree.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "The leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptic to obovate in shape.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen",
  "flower_color_ai": "White or pale yellow",
  "fruit_type_ai": "The fruit consists of two separate follicles that are asymmetrical, obliquely ellipsoid, and brightly colored in yellow, orange, or red when ripe.",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "The bark is pale gray and exudes a milky latex when damaged.",
  "maximum_height_ai": 14,
  "maximum_diameter_ai": 2.5,
  "lifespan_ai": "Perennial, long-lived species under favorable conditions.",
  "maximum_tree_age_ai": null,
