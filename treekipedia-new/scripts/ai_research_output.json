  "taxon_id": "AngNAParc36603-00",
  "species_scientific_name": "Phoenix dactylifera",
  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Full sun, deep watering, annual pruning, avoid trunk injury",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Plant date palms in full sun with at least six hours of direct sunlight daily. Use sandy or loamy soils that drain well; date palms tolerate both salt and alkaline conditions but prefer slightly acidic to alkaline pH.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Prune in late spring or early summer (Mayâ€“June), removing old, damaged, or diseased fronds. Avoid removing too many green fronds to maintain photosynthesis and energy production. Remove date stalks as needed to control fruit load; sterilize pruning tools to avoid disease spread.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Watch for red palm weevil; symptoms include wilted leaves, trunk holes, and sawdust-like frass. Remove infested fronds promptly; use targeted insecticides as needed. Keep trunk bases clear of weeds and turf within a 1.5-meter radius to reduce habitat for pests and disease. Never climb palms with spiked shoes as this damages the trunk and increases vulnerability to pests and diseases.",
  "fire_management_ai": "While mature palms are somewhat fire resistant due to their fibrous trunks, accumulated dry fronds and fruit stalks create a fire hazard. Regular removal of dead fronds and litter is recommended to reduce risk.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Prefer sandy or loamy soils with excellent drainage. Tolerant to saline and alkaline soils. Avoid heavy clay or poorly drained locations.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "Date palms have been integral to Middle Eastern and North African societies for millennia, symbolizing hospitality, prosperity, and fertility. The fruit is a staple food, while palm fronds and trunks are historically used for construction, crafts, and fuel.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Not threatened due to widespread cultivation, though wild populations may face habitat loss and genetic erosion.",
  "general_description_ai": "Phoenix dactylifera, commonly known as the date palm, is a medium to tall, feather-leaved palm native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. These trees are characterized by columnar trunks, dense crowns of pinnate fronds, and clusters of edible date fruits.",
  "habitat_ai": "Deserts, oases, riparian zones (native); adaptable to similar global climates.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": "Sea level to ~1,500 m (best at low elevations).",
  "ecological_function_ai": "Provide habitat and shade for understory plants and animals, serve as a food source for people and wildlife, and offer nesting and roosting structures for birds and insects.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Naturally found in oases, deserts, and riparian corridors of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and western Asia. Widely cultivated in similar climates globally.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Date palms are foundation species in traditional oasis agroforestry, providing canopy shade and shelter for understory crops and livestock. Their deep roots stabilize soil and help prevent desertification, while organic matter from fronds builds soil fertility.",
  "growth_form_ai": "Solitary, unbranched, monocotyledonous tree with a single, vertical, columnar trunk.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Pinnate, up to 5 meters long, with folded, narrow leaflets.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen",
  "flower_color_ai": "Creamy-white to yellowish",
  "fruit_type_ai": "Oblong, one-seeded drupe (date)",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "The trunk is brown, rough, and marked with the pruned stubs of old leaf bases, creating a diamond or chevron pattern.",

  "maximum_diameter_ai": 0.5,
  "lifespan_ai": "Up to 150 years",
