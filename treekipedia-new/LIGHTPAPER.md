# Treekipedia: Tree Intelligence Commons

## Overview

Treekipedia is an open-source, comprehensive database of tree knowledge. Developed by Silvi, Treekipedia provides a unified, structured, and AI-enhanced repository of species data, reforestation methodologies, and ecological insights. By integrating consolidated biodiversity data, AI research agents, and community-driven contributions, Treekipedia ensures reliable, transparent, and accessible tree knowledge for tree stewards, researchers, and citizen scientists worldwide.

## The Problem: Fragmented and Static Tree Knowledge

Scientific and ecological data on trees are scattered across institutional archives, peer-reviewed studies, and community-driven sources, with over 70% of this data existing in unstructured, non-machine-readable formats. Local stewards and reforestation practitioners hold valuable field knowledge, yet this insight is often missing from centralized databases. These inefficiencies slow down reforestation efforts, ecological modeling, and sustainable land management.

Additionally, as climate change reshapes ecosystems, tree habitat suitability and stewardship practices must evolve. There is an urgent need for a living, shared database that can adapt to real-world ecological changes. Treekipedia addresses this by structuring and decentralizing tree intelligence into an open-access, evolving knowledge system.

## Treekipedia's Approach: A Unified Database

Treekipedia is designed as an interoperable knowledge hub, enabling institutions, researchers, and tree stewards to contribute, query, and verify tree-related information. It ensures transparency and accuracy by integrating AI-driven analytics, blockchain-verified data provenance, and decentralized validation models.

At its core, Treekipedia consolidates species data, ecological insights, and reforestation methodologies into a structured, AI-enhanced repository. AI research agents autonomously extract, synthesize, and organize tree data from sources such as academic papers, government records, and community-contributed observations. These agents not only standardize taxonomic and ecological classifications but also continuously expand the dataset with new research findings.

To maintain credibility and transparency, Treekipedia integrates **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** to validate AI-generated research. When a user initiates a research request, the AI agent compiles relevant data, pins the research output to IPFS, and generates a cryptographic attestation via EAS. This process ensures that all contributions remain verifiable, tamper-resistant, and permanently recorded.

Beyond AI and blockchain verification, Treekipedia is community-driven. Tree stewards, researchers, and citizen scientists can contribute firsthand insights, validate data, and refine reforestation methodologies. Contributions follow standardized tree knowledge schemas, ensuring interoperability across biodiversity databases, conservation platforms, and ecological research institutions.

Treekipedia also introduces blockchain-backed incentives to fund research and encourage participation. Through **Contreebution NFTs**, users can sponsor AI-driven research for specific species at a low cost (~$3 per species). These NFTs, minted across multiple chains, provide on-chain records of contributions while supporting ongoing database expansion. In the future, governance will be further decentralized through **DeepTrees NFT** collections, where *Iconic Species NFTs* may play a role in guiding Treekipedia's evolution and funding ecosystem initiatives.

By combining AI, decentralized validation, and open collaboration, Treekipedia is not just a static database—it is an expanding intelligence network for tree knowledge. Whether used by scientists modeling forest dynamics, land stewards planning reforestation projects, or conservationists tracking biodiversity, Treekipedia will serve as a core infrastructure layer for global reforestation intelligence.

## Silvi and Treekipedia

Treekipedia is developed and supported by **Silvi**, a blockchain-powered reforestation protocol. Silvi has already integrated Treekipedia as its species data source within the Silvi App, making it the authoritative knowledge base for tree intelligence in Silvi's ecosystem.

Treekipedia's foundation was built through extensive data collection, cleaning, and structuring. Over the past year, the team has aggregated **25 million+ raw species records** from 10+ global biodiversity datasets, including GBIF, iNaturalist, SiBBr, and SpeciesLink. After deduplication, taxonomy validation, and synonym resolution, the dataset now includes **50,000+ unique tree species** with **17.6 million observational records**.

Treekipedia's ontology is structured around 50+ taxonomic, ecological, and functional attributes, providing a standardized framework for knowledge retrieval. A custom TaxonID system ensures unique species identification and data consistency across datasets.

For decentralized access and long-term integrity, Treekipedia integrates Blazegraph for structured querying and IPFS for decentralized storage, where AI-generated research reports are permanently pinned. Additionally, species distributions are being mapped across ecoregions and biomes using OneEarth's bioregional framework, expanding interoperability with conservation and reforestation initiatives.

This foundation sets the stage for Treekipedia's next evolution—an AI-enhanced, decentralized ecosystem for tree intelligence.

## Roadmap

Treekipedia is being developed through a structured roadmap, progressively expanding its capabilities, refining infrastructure, and increasing community participation.
