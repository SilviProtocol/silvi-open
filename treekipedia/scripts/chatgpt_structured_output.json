  "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Date Palm stewardship relies on careful site selection, minimal but timely pruning, vigilant pest management, and maintaining soil and water balance—making it both an ecologically significant and culturally treasured species in arid agriculture.",
  "planting_recipes_ai": "Select a full sun location with good drainage. Prepare a large hole (at least 2x root ball size). Add organic matter or well-rotted manure to sandy soils. Plant at the same depth as the nursery pot, backfill, and water thoroughly. Mulch but keep 1.5 m radius around the base weed-free.",
  "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Minimal pruning required: remove only dead, diseased, or damaged fronds. Best time: late spring to early summer (May–June). Do not remove too many green fronds, as this reduces energy production. Avoid using spiked shoes during pruning to prevent trunk injury. Remove suckers as needed for single-trunk specimens.",
  "disease_pest_management_ai": "Main pests include the Red palm weevil. Remove infected fronds and use targeted insecticides as needed. Monitor for fungal pathogens in humid areas; ensure air circulation and avoid excess moisture. Sterilize pruning tools to reduce disease spread.",
  "fire_management_ai": "Date Palm has moderate fire resistance due to high moisture content in fronds. Remove dry, dead fronds to reduce fuel load.",
  "compatible_soil_types_ai": "Prefers sandy or loamy, well-draining soils. Tolerates saline and alkaline soils; optimal pH is slightly acidic to alkaline.",
  "cultural_significance_ai": "Revered in Middle Eastern, North African, and Islamic cultures as a symbol of hospitality and prosperity. Dates are a staple food dating back thousands of years, essential for food security and traditional celebrations.",
  "conservation_status_ai": "Not globally threatened, widely cultivated, but wild populations may be vulnerable due to habitat loss and genetic erosion from monoculture practices.",
  "general_description_ai": "Phoenix dactylifera, or Date Palm, is a medium to large palm producing edible dates, with a single, columnar trunk up to 30 m tall and a dense crown of feather-like fronds.",
  "habitat_ai": "Native to Middle Eastern and North African deserts, it thrives in hot, arid regions.",
  "elevation_ranges_ai": "Sea level up to about 1,500 m elevation.",
  "ecological_function_ai": "Provides shade, microhabitat, and food for wildlife. Dates are a crucial food source for various mammals and birds. The tree’s canopy mediates microclimates in agro-ecosystems and acts as a windbreak.",
  "native_adapted_habitats_ai": "Hot, dry desert oases and irrigated arid lands.",
  "agroforestry_use_cases_ai": "Commonly intercropped with vegetables, cereals, and forage crops in oasis agroforestry. Provides shade, wind protection, and improves microclimates for understory crops. Suitable for rehabilitation of saline and degraded lands due to salt tolerance.",
  "growth_form_ai": "Tall, columnar, solitary palm tree with a heavy, unbranched trunk.",
  "leaf_type_ai": "Pinnate (feather-like) leaves, each up to 5 meters long.",
  "deciduous_evergreen_ai": "Evergreen.",
  "flower_color_ai": "Creamy-white or yellowish.",
  "fruit_type_ai": "A one-seeded berry (drupe), known as the date.",
  "bark_characteristics_ai": "Brown, rough, and marked with pruned stubs of old leaf bases, giving a characteristic diamond pattern.",
  "maximum_height_ai": 23,
  "maximum_diameter_ai": 0.5,
  "lifespan_ai": "Up to 150 years.",
