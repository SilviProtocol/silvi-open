      "raw_response": "I'll search for specific information about Quercus robur and compile it according to your requirements.Let me search for more specific information about cultivation, maintenance, and cultural significance.Let me search for more specific information about elevation ranges and fire management.Based on the search results, I'll compile a comprehensive JSON response about Quercus robur with the requested characteristics:\n\n{\n    \"habitat_ai\": Native to most of Europe and western Asia, this species grows on soils of near neutral acidity in the lowlands. It can be found on the margins of swamps, rivers and ponds, showing tolerance for intermittent flooding. The species is found in a wide array of habitats, from lowland forests to the edges of woodlands, though it is less common in Mediterranean regions due to its preference for temperate climates,\n\n    \"elevation_ranges_ai\": The species can grow at altitudes of nearly 500m (1,600ft). More specific elevation range data not available.\n\n    \"ecological_function_ai\": The English Oak is a cornerstone of UK biodiversity and is considered a keystone species, supporting a disproportionately large number of other organisms in its ecosystem. It provides habitat for over 2,300 species of wildlife, more than any other native tree in the UK. The tree supports over 400 species of caterpillars, which provide food for birds like blue tits and great tits. Its rough bark hosts various lichens, mosses, and fungi, while its acorns are a vital food source for squirrels, jays, and deer. Additionally, oak trees play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change effects by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide.\n\n    \"native_adapted_habitats_ai\": The English Oak is native to Europe, particularly the British Isles, France, Germany, and parts of Eastern Europe. It thrives in various habitats from lowland forests to woodland edges, preferring well-drained, fertile soils but showing adaptability to different conditions. It is rare on thin, well-drained calcareous (chalk and limestone) soil, but can tolerate intermittent flooding near water bodies.\n\n    \"agroforestry_use_cases_ai\": The wood is highly valued for its strength, durability, and resistance to decay. It's used in construction, shipbuilding, furniture making, and for barrels in wine and whiskey production. It can be grown as a hedge to attract wildlife, providing shelter and habitat, and serves as a nectar/pollen source for pollinators.\n\n    \"conservation_status_ai\": Acute oak decline and chronic oak decline are serious conditions affecting Britain's oaks, with several contributing factors. Decline of mature oaks first aroused concern in the 1920s and today most cases are in central, southern and eastern England. Conservation efforts are in place to protect the oak and ensure its survival, including initiatives to preserve ancient woodlands, restore degraded habitats, plant new oak forests, and monitor and control the spread of diseases.\n\n    \"stewardship_best_practices_ai\": Young trees need regular watering to establish their root system, especially during dry spells. Once established, English Oak is quite drought-tolerant but benefits from deep watering during prolonged dry periods. Watering should be reduced in fall to prepare for winter dormancy. Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around the base to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Keep mulch away from the trunk to avoid moisture buildup that could lead to bark decay.\n\n    \"planting_recipes_ai\": Choose a site with full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. English Oak prefers deep, well-drained, fertile soils but can adapt to various soil types, including clay, loam, or sandy soils. It's adaptable to different pH levels but thrives best in slightly acidic to neutral soils. Consider the tree's mature size, ensuring there's enough space for its expansive crown and roots.\n\n    \"pruning_maintenance_ai\": After establishment, prune only to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. This species doesn't respond well to heavy pruning, so keep cuts minimal. Late winter to early spring, before new growth starts, is the best time for pruning. Only remove branches that are damaged or broken due to storms; the tree will naturally shed unnecessary limbs over time.\n\n    \"disease_pest_management_ai\": English Oaks can be susceptible to various pests and diseases, including oak wilt, powdery mildew, and pests like the oak processionary moth in Europe. Monitor for signs of disease or pest infestation and manage through cultural practices like proper spacing for air circulation, or, if necessary, through integrated pest management strategies, preferring biological controls over chemical ones.\n\n    \"fire_management_ai\": \"Data not available\",\n\n    \"cultural_significance_ai\": It is a very long-lived tree, with the oldest known specimens living for more than a thousand years. It is commonly represented in European mythologies as a symbol of strength, longevity, nobility, morale, and knowledge. The history of Quercus robur is deeply intertwined with human civilization in Europe. Since prehistoric times, it has been a vital resource, its wood used for constructing buildings, ships, and furniture due to its strength and longevity.\n\n    \"general_description_ai\": The English Oak is a large deciduous tree, often reaching heights of 20 to 40 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy that can extend just as wide. The tree has a thick, deeply ridged bark that becomes more textured with age, giving it an ancient and rugged appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and broadly oval to nearly round, with 4 to 7 short, rounded lobes. They are 2 to 4 inches long, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a paler, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The leaves turn brown in autumn rather than displaying bright colors, often staying on the tree into winter.\n\n    \"compatible_soil_types_ai\": Suitable for medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Can grow in mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. This tree is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils. It is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions but performs best in moist, well-drained loams. The species is drought tolerant.\n}",

It can be found on the margins of swamps, rivers and ponds, showing tolerance for intermittent flooding. The species is found in a wide array of habitats, from lowland forests to the edges of woodlands, though it is less common in Mediterranean regions due to its preference for temperate climates,\n\n    \"elevation_ranges_ai\": The species can grow at altitudes of nearly 500m (1,600ft). More specific elevation range data not available.\n\n    \"ecological_function_ai\": The English Oak is a cornerstone of UK biodiversity and is considered a keystone species, supporting a disproportionately large number of other organisms in its ecosystem. It provides habitat for over 2,300 species of wildlife, more than any other native tree in the UK. The tree supports over 400 species of caterpillars, which provide food for birds like blue tits and great tits. Its rough bark hosts various lichens, mosses, and fungi, while its acorns are a vital food source for squirrels, jays, and deer. Additionally, oak trees play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change effects by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide.\n\n    \"native_adapted_habitats_ai\": The English Oak is native to Europe, particularly the British Isles, France, Germany, and parts of Eastern Europe. It thrives in various habitats from lowland forests to woodland edges, preferring well-drained, fertile soils but showing adaptability to different conditions. It is rare on thin, well-drained calcareous (chalk and limestone) soil, but can tolerate intermittent flooding near water bodies.\n\n    \"agroforestry_use_cases_ai\": The wood is highly valued for its strength, durability, and resistance to decay. It's used in construction, shipbuilding, furniture making, and for barrels in wine and whiskey production. It can be grown as a hedge to attract wildlife, providing shelter and habitat, and serves as a nectar/pollen source for pollinators.\n\n    \"conservation_status_ai\": Acute oak decline and chronic oak decline are serious conditions affecting Britain's oaks, with several contributing factors. Decline of mature oaks first aroused concern in the 1920s and today most cases are in central, southern and eastern England. Conservation efforts are in place to protect the oak and ensure its survival, including initiatives to preserve ancient woodlands, restore degraded habitats, plant new oak forests, and monitor and control the spread of diseases.\n\n    \"stewardship_best_practices_ai\": Young trees need regular watering to establish their root system, especially during dry spells. Once established, English Oak is quite drought-tolerant but benefits from deep watering during prolonged dry periods. Watering should be reduced in fall to prepare for winter dormancy. Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around the base to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Keep mulch away from the trunk to avoid moisture buildup that could lead to bark decay.\n\n    \"planting_recipes_ai\": Choose a site with full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. English Oak prefers deep, well-drained, fertile soils but can adapt to various soil types, including clay, loam, or sandy soils. It's adaptable to different pH levels but thrives best in slightly acidic to neutral soils. Consider the tree's mature size, ensuring there's enough space for its expansive crown and roots.\n\n    \"pruning_maintenance_ai\": After establishment, prune only to remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. This species doesn't respond well to heavy pruning, so keep cuts minimal. Late winter to early spring, before new growth starts, is the best time for pruning. Only remove branches that are damaged or broken due to storms; the tree will naturally shed unnecessary limbs over time.\n\n    \"disease_pest_management_ai\": English Oaks can be susceptible to various pests and diseases, including oak wilt, powdery mildew, and pests like the oak processionary moth in Europe. Monitor for signs of disease or pest infestation and manage through cultural practices like proper spacing for air circulation, or, if necessary, through integrated pest management strategies, preferring biological controls over chemical ones.\n\n    \"fire_management_ai\": \"Data not available\",\n\n    \"cultural_significance_ai\": It is a very long-lived tree, with the oldest known specimens living for more than a thousand years. It is commonly represented in European mythologies as a symbol of strength, longevity, nobility, morale, and knowledge. The history of Quercus robur is deeply intertwined with human civilization in Europe. Since prehistoric times, it has been a vital resource, its wood used for constructing buildings, ships, and furniture due to its strength and longevity.\n\n    \"general_description_ai\": The English Oak is a large deciduous tree, often reaching heights of 20 to 40 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy that can extend just as wide. The tree has a thick, deeply ridged bark that becomes more textured with age, giving it an ancient and rugged appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and broadly oval to nearly round, with 4 to 7 short, rounded lobes. They are 2 to 4 inches long, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a paler, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The leaves turn brown in autumn rather than displaying bright colors, often staying on the tree into winter.\n\n    \"compatible_soil_types_ai\": Suitable for medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Can grow in mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. This tree is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils. It is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions but performs best in moist, well-drained loams. The species is drought tolerant.\n}"
