    "planting_recipes_ai": "To plant a ginkgo:\n1. Loosen the soil and dig a hole that can accommodate deep roots\n2. Add compost to the excavated soil for extra nutrients\n3.

It is a cultural icon associated with hope and fertility. To ancient Chinese people, the ginkgo was more than a botanical curiosity. It was a manifestation of the sacred concept of yin and yang, primarily symbolizing longevity and vitality. The trees often marked locations of early shamanic worship and were ideal candidates for shamanic tree worship due to their mysterious, long-living nature."

The elevation ranges from 300-1250 meters above sea level, specifically documented in locations like Mt. Tianmu and Mt. Dalou.\n\nHistorically, Ginkgo was largely confined to disturbed streamside and levee environments, showing strong ecological conservatism. The species shows high resistance to environmental stresses, microbial diseases, pests, and pollutants, making it a model for studying disease resistance and stress in plants.\n\nThe IUCN has listed the species as endangered due to declining tree numbers. Future climate scenarios suggest potential positive impacts, with more climatically suitable areas expected under moderate warming scenarios.\n\nAs a living fossil, Ginkgo biloba has fossil records dating back 270 million years, originating in China and historically used for medicinal purposes. It survives in a wide range of temperatures (-3.3 to 23.3°C) and precipitation conditions, preferring warm, humid, open-canopy environments with good drainage. The species shows strong tolerance to drought, freezing, fire, air pollution, and heavy metals.",
