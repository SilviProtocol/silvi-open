It is drought-tolerant once established and requires minimal watering after the first few years, based on practical advice from gardening resources and grower communities.",

It is often done in late winter or early spring to maintain shape, with no regular pruning required as the tree has a naturally attractive form. Limited information available from practical sources on specific timing or techniques.",
    "disease_pest_management_ai": "Ginkgo biloba is highly resistant to most pests and diseases, but may occasionally face issues with aphids, scale insects, or fungal diseases like leaf spot. Management involves monitoring and using horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps for pests, and improving air circulation for diseases. No chemical treatments are usually needed due to its resilience, based on gardening forums and biological flora resources.",

It is used in traditional medicine for cognitive health and has ceremonial roles in Buddhism, with historical documentation from ethnobotanical sources and cultural narratives."
