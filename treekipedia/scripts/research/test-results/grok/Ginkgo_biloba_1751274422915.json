    "general_description_ai": "Ginkgo biloba is a large deciduous tree, typically growing 20-35 meters tall, with distinctive fan-shaped leaves that turn golden yellow in autumn; it is dioecious, with separate male and female trees, and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage.",

    "stewardship_best_practices_ai": "Best practices include planting only male cultivars to avoid the foul-smelling fruit from females, ensuring the tree is placed in full sun for optimal growth, and using well-draining soil to prevent root rot; regular watering is needed during establishment, with mature trees being drought-tolerant.",
    "planting_recipes_ai": "Plant in full sun with well-draining soil; best done in spring or fall, with trees spaced 20-30 feet apart to accommodate mature size; adaptable to various soil types including urban soils.",
    "pruning_maintenance_ai": "Prune in late winter or early spring to maintain shape and remove dead wood; minimal pruning is typically required due to the tree's strong branching habit.",
