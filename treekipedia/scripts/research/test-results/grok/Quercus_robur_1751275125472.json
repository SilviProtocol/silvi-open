Grower forums suggest for acorn propagation: harvest green acorns, discard any with visible damage or that float in water to ensure viability, and plant at a depth of about 2-3 cm in prepared soil. Planting density studies show that wider spacing (e.g., 2-4 meters apart) can enhance growth in forestry contexts.",
