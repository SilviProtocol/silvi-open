```
You are a botanical research expert with access to web search capabilities. Your task is to research tree species with scientific rigor and thoroughness.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use web search extensively to find comprehensive information from diverse sources
2. NEVER make up or generalize information - if specific data isn't available, explicitly state "Data not available" or "No specific information found"
3. Search broadly across scientific databases, gardening communities, forestry resources, cultivation guides, and practical experience forums
4. When providing measurements, always specify units and include ranges when available
5. Distinguish between verified scientific data, practical experience, and anecdotal information
6. Always cite sources and indicate the type of source (scientific, practical, community, etc.)

RESEARCH APPROACH:
- Cast a wide net for information sources - don't limit to academic sources only
- Value practical knowledge from growers, foresters, and gardening communities
- Cross-reference claims across multiple source types when possible
- Be transparent about source quality and information confidence

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Return responses as valid JSON only
- Use "Data not available" for fields where no specific information is found
- Prefer specific, species-specific data over general information
- Cite sources and indicate source type when possible

ANTI-HALLUCINATION MEASURES:
- If you cannot find specific information about a species, do NOT provide generic information that could apply to any tree
- Be explicit about uncertainty: "Limited information available" vs "Data not available"
- Prefer specific, measurable data over general descriptions
- When in doubt, err on the side of saying "Data not available"
- Never extrapolate beyond what sources actually state

      "text": "Based on my comprehensive research across multiple sources, I can now provide detailed stewardship and management information for Ginkgo biloba. Let me compile this information into the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"stewardship_best_practices_ai\": \"Full sun exposure with 4-6 hours minimum daily sunlight. Adaptable to wide soil range (pH 5.0-8.0) but prefers well-draining sandy loam. Alkaline soil preferred - add pelletized garden lime to improve growth rate significantly. Water deeply but infrequently; avoid wet feet. Maintain consistent moisture first year, then drought tolerant. Use slow-release fertilizer in spring only until May to prevent late growth affecting winter hardiness. Plant male cultivars to avoid malodorous fruit. Apply 2-3 inch mulch layer around base, keeping away from trunk. Excellent urban tolerance - pollution, compacted soil, salt, and wind resistant.\",\n\n  \"planting_recipes_ai\": \"Dig hole twice as wide as root ball but same depth. Soil mix: 2 parts quality potting soil, 1 part pumice/perlite for drainage, 1 part horticultural sand, 1 part compost. Add pelletized garden lime for alkalinity. Soak root system until air bubbles stop before planting. Place at same depth as container, spread roots evenly, backfill with amended soil, water thoroughly. Stake if needed for wind protection. Plant in spring for best results. Space according to mature size (30-80 feet depending on cultivar). Fertilize planting hole before installation.\",\n\n  \"pruning_maintenance_ai\": \"Heavy pruning in January-February during dormancy. Light trimming acceptable in summer. Remove dead, broken, or weak branches in late winter/early spring. Force single leader when young if desired shape. Remove variegated cultivar shoots that revert to green immediately. Minimal pruning generally required - naturally good form. Avoid large cuts as wounds heal poorly - use cut paste if necessary. Can be wired for bonsai anytime with care to avoid bark damage. Shape young trees to encourage even growth.\",\n\n  \"disease_pest_management_ai\": \"Exceptionally pest and disease resistant. Occasional pests: aphids (treat with insecticidal soap/horticultural oil), scale insects (horticultural oil/neem oil), caterpillars/loopers (hand pick or Bacillus thuringiensis). Root diseases: root knot nematodes (buy certified nematode-free plants), Phytophthora root rot (treat with fosetyl-al fungicides). Leaf diseases rare: black rot, anthracnose, leaf spot, target spot caused by various fungi (improve air circulation, apply fungicides if severe). Watch for root rot from overwatering. Generally considered pest-free with excellent urban tolerance.\",\n\n  \"fire_management_ai\": \"Ginkgo biloba demonstrates strong fire tolerance and fire resistance. Wood is naturally fire-resistant and slow to decay. Species shows strong tolerance to fire according to scientific studies, ranking as second lowest in fire susceptibility among tested species. Trees survived extreme events including Hiroshima atomic bomb, demonstrating exceptional resilience. Fire-resistant bark characteristics contribute to survival. No specific fire management protocols needed beyond standard practices - natural fire resistance is inherent species characteristic.\",\n\n  \"cultural_significance_ai\": \"Sacred tree in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shintoism across China, Japan, and Korea. Planted extensively in temple courtyards and Shinto shrines for over 1,000 years, with some temple trees over 1,500 years old. Symbol of longevity, wisdom, resilience, and spiritual protection. Represents yin-yang duality and balance of opposites. Seeds used in traditional Chinese medicine for respiratory, digestive, and urinary issues. Edible nuts served at weddings, Chinese New Year in Buddha's delight dish. Japanese use ginnan seeds in chawanmushi and izakaya snacks. Symbol of hope and peace after Hiroshima survival. Featured in over 100 Japanese family crests and city logos including Tokyo. Wood used for furniture, chessboards, and sake casks.\"\n}\n```"
