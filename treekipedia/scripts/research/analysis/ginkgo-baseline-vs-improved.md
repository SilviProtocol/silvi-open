|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **conservation_status_ai** | Wild populations are extremely rare and threatened. Conservation focuses on protecting remaining wild populations and maintaining genetic diversity in cultivated specimens. | Listed as Endangered (EN) according to IUCN Red List criteria due to rapid decline in numbers of individual trees around the world. Classified under China's List of Wild Plants under State Priority Conservation (first-class state), Red Book of Chinese Plants, and China Species Red List. Given high priority conservation status by the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) method, ranking second highest EDGE score for gymnosperms and number one for evolutionary distinctiveness. |
| **general_description_ai** | Ginkgo biloba is a deciduous gymnosperm with fan-shaped leaves and is the sole surviving member of a lineage over 270 million years old, known for its resilience and adaptability. | Ginkgo biloba is a deciduous gymnosperm tree, dioecious (separate male and female trees), reaching 20-35 meters tall (some specimens over 50 meters in China), with angular crown and long, erratic branches. Features unique fan-shaped, two-lobed leaves that turn golden-yellow in autumn. Deep-rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Male trees produce small pollen cones; female trees produce paired ovules developing into yellowish, plum-like seeds with foul-smelling fleshy outer layer. Extremely long-lived (can exceed 1,000 years), disease-resistant, and capable of clonal reproduction. |
| **ecological_function_ai** | Ginkgo provides high oxygen production, excellent air pollution filtration, soil stabilization, urban heat island effect mitigation, and carbon sequestration. | As a living fossil and sole surviving member of the order Ginkgoales, Ginkgo biloba represents a pre-angiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments. The species exhibits extreme fire resistance, making it valuable for fire protection in ecosystems. It demonstrates remarkable resistance to environmental stresses, diseases, and pollutants, serving as a model species for studying disease resistance and stress tolerance in plants. Seeds are animal-dispersed, contributing to forest regeneration, though natural reproduction is limited in current populations. |
| **habitat_ai** | Native to regions with rocky terrain and thin soils, ginkgo trees have adapted to various climates and urban conditions. | Ginkgo biloba is native to East Asia, specifically southeastern China, and naturally occurs in deciduous forests and valleys along flood-disturbed streamsides in warm-temperate deciduous and evergreen mixed broadleaved forests. Historically confined to disturbed streamside and levee environments with acidic loess (fine, silty soil) with good drainage. Natural populations exist at Mt. Tianmu (300-1250 m elevation) and Mt. Dalou (840-1200 m elevation) in China. The species shows extreme ecological conservatism, restricting to disturbed streamside environments throughout its evolutionary history. |
| **elevation_ranges_ai** | Not specifically mentioned, but adaptable to various elevations due to climate adaptability. | 300-1250 meters above sea level in natural habitats at Mt. Tianmu, eastern China, and 840-1200 meters above sea level at Mt. Dalou, southwestern China. Global cultivation records show the species can grow from -2.99 meters to 1339.13 meters above sea level, though it is mostly planted in lowlands of coastal and urban regions. |
| **compatible_soil_types_ai** | Tolerant of urban compacted soils, various pH levels, poor quality soils, drought conditions once established, and areas with salt exposure. | Highly adaptable to various soil types including sandy loam, clay, acidic loess, compacted soils, and both alkaline and acidic conditions. Prefers well-drained, moist sandy soils with pH range of 5.0-8.0 (some sources indicate tolerance up to pH 10). Natural habitat soil typically has pH 5.0-5.5. Tolerates saline conditions, air pollution, and urban soil conditions. Requires good drainage to prevent root rot - intolerant of waterlogged conditions. Shows remarkable tolerance to poor and compacted soils compared to most tree species. |
| **native_adapted_habitats_ai** | Adapted to rocky terrains with thin soils; thrives in urban environments. | Originally native to three glacial refugia in eastern, southern, and southwestern China, particularly in mountains surrounding the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Adapted to warm-temperate climates with mean annual temperatures ranging from -3.3 to 23.3°C and annual precipitation from 34-3925 mm. Natural habitat includes mixed mesophytic forests along the Yangtze River valley border, characterized by limestone soil and subtropical hot, humid climate conditions. |
| **agroforestry_use_cases_ai** | Used in urban forestry, windbreaks, medicinal cultivation, edible seed production, and ornamental planting. | Extensively used in Chinese agroforestry systems, particularly Ginkgo-Wheat-Peanut (G+W+P), Ginkgo-Rapeseed-Peanut (G+R+P), and Ginkgo-Mulberry systems. In Pizhou county, Jiangsu Province, approximately 30,000 hectares are under Ginkgo plantation. The wide spacing required for maximum fruit yield (first production at 8-10 years) allows intercropping with agricultural crops, providing both short-term benefits from crops and long-term benefits from Ginkgo nuts and leaves. Used for medicinal leaf production, ornamental purposes, and sustainable forest management. |
| **growth_form_ai** | Typically grows 20–35 meters with some over 50 meters, irregular crown shape that becomes broader or pyramidal with age. | Large deciduous tree with pyramidal shape when young, becoming broadly ovoid and more spreading with age. Crown initially conical, developing angular form with long, somewhat erratic branches. Columnar, sparingly branched trunk. Branches nearly verticillate, ascending at about 45° from trunk. Often irregular shape with large branches forming secondary trunks. |
| **leaf_type_ai** | Fan-shaped leaves with dichotomous venation, turning bright yellow in autumn. | Simple, alternate, fan-shaped (flabellate) leaves, 3-7.5 cm long and wide, resembling maidenhair fern leaflets. Two-lobed with central notch (biloba), dichotomously veined with parallel veins entering from petiole and forking repeatedly toward edges. Borne in clusters of 3-5 on short spurs or singly on long shoots. Leathery texture, emerald green in summer turning brilliant golden-yellow in autumn. |
| **deciduous_evergreen_ai** | Deciduous | Deciduous - leaves turn golden-yellow in fall and drop rapidly, often all falling within 1-2 days |
| **flower_color_ai** | Male plants produce small pollen cones without distinctive flower color. | Inconspicuous reproductive structures (not true flowers as gymnosperm). Males produce small yellowish, catkin-like pollen cones 2.5 cm long, ivory-colored when mature. Females produce greenish ovules 2-3 mm long at end of 4-5 cm stalks. No petals or sepals. |
| **fruit_type_ai** | Mature seed with fleshy orange-yellow sarcotesta and hard bony sclerotesta. | Not true fruit but naked seeds (gymnosperm). Female trees produce plum-shaped seeds 1.5-2.5 cm diameter with fleshy yellow-brown to orange outer layer (sarcotesta) containing butyric acid producing foul odor when ripe, hard white inner shell (sclerotesta), and papery endotesta enclosing edible kernel. |
| **bark_characteristics_ai** | Bark becomes more rugged with age. | Light gray to grayish-brown bark, becoming deeply furrowed and ridged with age. Corky texture with longitudinal fissures especially prominent on mature trees. Young bark smooth, developing shallow ridges and furrows that become pronounced textured ridges on older specimens. |
| **maximum_height_ai** | 50.00 | 50 |
| **maximum_diameter_ai** | (null/empty) | 5 |
| **lifespan_ai** | Some specimens live over 2,500 years, making it one of the longest-lived species. | Extremely long-lived species capable of living thousands of years. Temple specimens in China believed to be over 1,500-1,800 years old. Scientific studies show trees up to 667 years old displaying no genetic evidence of senescence and continuing to grow indefinitely. |
| **maximum_tree_age_ai** | 2500 | 3500 |
| **stewardship_best_practices_ai** | Ginkgo biloba requires site selection with full sun to partial shade, 25-40 feet spacing for mature specimens, and soil preparation with well-draining amendments. Male cultivars are preferred to avoid malodorous seeds. | Full sun exposure with 4-6 hours minimum daily sunlight. Adaptable to wide soil range (pH 5.0-8.0) but prefers well-draining sandy loam. Alkaline soil preferred - add pelletized garden lime to improve growth rate significantly. Water deeply but infrequently; avoid wet feet. Maintain consistent moisture first year, then drought tolerant. Use slow-release fertilizer in spring only until May to prevent late growth affecting winter hardiness. Plant male cultivars to avoid malodorous fruit. Apply 2-3 inch mulch layer around base, keeping away from trunk. Excellent urban tolerance - pollution, compacted soil, salt, and wind resistant. |
| **planting_recipes_ai** | Choose locations with full sun to partial shade and provide 25-40 feet spacing. Amend soil for better drainage if possible. | Dig hole twice as wide as root ball but same depth. Soil mix: 2 parts quality potting soil, 1 part pumice/perlite for drainage, 1 part horticultural sand, 1 part compost. Add pelletized garden lime for alkalinity. Soak root system until air bubbles stop before planting. Place at same depth as container, spread roots evenly, backfill with amended soil, water thoroughly. Stake if needed for wind protection. Plant in spring for best results. Space according to mature size (30-80 feet depending on cultivar). Fertilize planting hole before installation. |
| **pruning_maintenance_ai** | Prune in late winter during dormancy. Remove damaged or diseased branches and shape young trees to establish a strong branch structure while maintaining a central leader. | Heavy pruning in January-February during dormancy. Light trimming acceptable in summer. Remove dead, broken, or weak branches in late winter/early spring. Force single leader when young if desired shape. Remove variegated cultivar shoots that revert to green immediately. Minimal pruning generally required - naturally good form. Avoid large cuts as wounds heal poorly - use cut paste if necessary. Can be wired for bonsai anytime with care to avoid bark damage. Shape young trees to encourage even growth. |
| **disease_pest_management_ai** | Ginkgo is highly resistant to most microbial diseases and few insect pests. It is also resistant to fungal pathogens common to other landscape trees. | Exceptionally pest and disease resistant. Occasional pests: aphids (treat with insecticidal soap/horticultural oil), scale insects (horticultural oil/neem oil), caterpillars/loopers (hand pick or Bacillus thuringiensis). Root diseases: root knot nematodes (buy certified nematode-free plants), Phytophthora root rot (treat with fosetyl-al fungicides). Leaf diseases rare: black rot, anthracnose, leaf spot, target spot caused by various fungi (improve air circulation, apply fungicides if severe). Watch for root rot from overwatering. Generally considered pest-free with excellent urban tolerance. |
| **fire_management_ai** | Ginkgo has thick bark providing some fire resistance and can regenerate from roots after severe damage, with low resin content reducing flammability. | Ginkgo biloba demonstrates strong fire tolerance and fire resistance. Wood is naturally fire-resistant and slow to decay. Species shows strong tolerance to fire according to scientific studies, ranking as second lowest in fire susceptibility among tested species. Trees survived extreme events including Hiroshima atomic bomb, demonstrating exceptional resilience. Fire-resistant bark characteristics contribute to survival. No specific fire management protocols needed beyond standard practices - natural fire resistance is inherent species characteristic. |
| **cultural_significance_ai** | Ginkgo is a symbol of longevity and resilience in East Asian cultures, valued in traditional medicine, and holds significance in bonsai artistry and sustainable urban planning. | Sacred tree in Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shintoism across China, Japan, and Korea. Planted extensively in temple courtyards and Shinto shrines for over 1,000 years, with some temple trees over 1,500 years old. Symbol of longevity, wisdom, resilience, and spiritual protection. Represents yin-yang duality and balance of opposites. Seeds used in traditional Chinese medicine for respiratory, digestive, and urinary issues. Edible nuts served at weddings, Chinese New Year in Buddha's delight dish. Japanese use ginnan seeds in chawanmushi and izakaya snacks. Symbol of hope and peace after Hiroshima survival. Featured in over 100 Japanese family crests and city logos including Tokyo. Wood used for furniture, chessboards, and sake casks. |
