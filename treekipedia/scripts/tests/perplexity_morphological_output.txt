Abarema cochliocarpos, commonly known as "barbatimão," is a tree species endemic to Brazil. Below are its detailed morphological characteristics:

### **Growth Form** 
- The tree displays two forms based on habitat:
  - **Coastal form**: Can exceed 10 meters in height.
  - **Inland form**: Grows up to 4 meters, with smaller and tougher leaflets[5][6].

### **Leaf Type**
- *Abarema cochliocarpos* has pinnately compound leaves characteristic of the Fabaceae family[5][6].

### **Deciduous or Evergreen Status**
- The species is evergreen, as is typical in its habitat range in Brazil's tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest[5][6].

### **Flower Color**
- The flowers of *Abarema cochliocarpos* are white, a common trait among species in the mimosoid clade of Fabaceae[5].

### **Fruit Type**
- The tree produces pods, typical of the legume family, containing multiple seeds[5].

### **Bark Characteristics**
- The bark is extensively used in traditional medicine and is rich in tannins and flavonoids. It is smooth to moderately textured[1][3][6].

### **Maximum Height**
- Coastal forms of the tree can surpass 10 meters, while inland forms grow up to 4 meters[5].

### **Maximum Diameter**
- While specific trunk diameter data is unavailable, the inland form's shorter stature suggests a smaller diameter compared to the coastal form[5].

### **Lifespan**
- The exact lifespan of the species is not documented, though its adaptability to various environments suggests longevity typical of trees in its biome.

### **Maximum Tree Age**
- No precise data is available on its maximum age; however, the species is commonly found in well-established forest and savanna ecosystems, indicating potential long-term growth.

This species thrives in diverse environments—from sandy coastal woodlands to inland scrub and savanna regions—and contributes significantly to traditional medicine due to its bioactive compounds.
