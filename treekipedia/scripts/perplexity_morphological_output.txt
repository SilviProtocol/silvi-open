## Morphological Characteristics of Phoenix dactylifera (Date Palm)

**Growth Form**
- Tall, columnar, solitary palm tree with a heavy, unbranched trunk[4][5].

**Leaf Type**
- Pinnate (feather-like) leaves, each up to 5 meters (16 feet) long[5].
- Leaves are moderately curved, with slightly drooping pinnae (leaflets)[4].
- Petioles (leaf bases) are armed with narrow spines, which are modified leaflets[1].
- The fronds are green to dusty greenish in color[4].

**Deciduous or Evergreen**
- Evergreen: Retains leaves throughout the year[4][5].

**Flower Characteristics**
- Flowers are small, borne on branched inflorescences (spikes) that emerge from the axils of previous year’s leaves[5].
- Plants are dioecious, so male and female flowers grow on separate trees[5].
- Male flowers: Fused tepals in two whorls.
- Female flowers: Three outer tepals fused into a cup, with three free inner tepals[1].

**Flower Color**
- Generally creamy-white or yellowish (inferred from typical palm morphology; not specified in the provided sources).

**Fruit Type**
- A one-seeded berry (drupe), known as the date[5].
- Fruit is oblong, variable in shape, size, and color depending on variety[5].
- The fruit has a smooth epicarp (skin), fleshy mesocarp, and thin endocarp; the seed often has a distinct longitudinal groove[1].

**Bark Characteristics**
- Trunk (stem) is brown, rough, and marked with pruned stubs of old leaf bases, giving a characteristic diamond pattern[3][5].
- The trunk does not have annual growth rings and its girth remains consistent upon reaching maturity[2][4].
- Composed of tough, fibrous vascular bundles with a lignified outer part[4].

**Maximum Height**
- Up to 23 meters (75 feet)[5].

**Maximum Diameter**
- Up to 0.5 meters (18 inches)[3]; average trunk circumference is about 1 to 1.1 meters (diameter ~0.3 to 0.35 meters)[4].

**Lifespan and Maximum Tree Age**
- Palms can live as long as 150 years, though commercial fruit production declines earlier and older palms are often replaced before this age[5].

These features collectively distinguish Phoenix dactylifera as one of the most economically and culturally significant palms worldwide[5].
