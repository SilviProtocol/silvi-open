GG24 Public Goods Tooling Development Round
Welcome to your one page guide to the Gitcoin Grant Round 24 Public Good Tooling Development Round under the Public Goods R&D domain.





If Ethereum public goods tool builders are connected to diverse forms of capital to build stronger network effects, foster deeper collaboration, and enhance interoperability across the ecosystem. Then public goods tooling will mature more rapidly and gain broader adoption across traditional markets and local communities. Because building resilient and impactful tools depends on trust, and trust grows through collective effort.

How To Participate
The round is split into two paths, pilot and growth with both focused on the round goals. Each pool uses Conviction Voting, a time based vote. Funded proposals in both pools are eligible for Retro Rewards, a performance based bonus.




Heads up, this page will be updated as the Pilot and Growth funding pools are setup on Gardens, the impact reporting framework finalized, and retro rewards determined.



Who is this for?
Builders of public goods infrastructure on Ethereum, including capital formation, capital allocation, identity/reputation, impact measurement, and any other tooling that public goods communities count on to effectively fund and coordinate their purpose.

Aspiring public goods builders looking to connect with the best in the public goods space, either to join an existing project or to fund their own idea for a tool or application build.



Round Goals
Increase Interoperability - Support projects integrating with shared public goods primitives

Create Collaborations - Prioritize teams demonstrating clear cross-project partnerships or co-development

Improve UI/UX - Fund solutions addressing key public goods UX challenges (for example, community onboarding, identity, or privacy)

Grow Project Maturity - Back projects with an active roadmap that clearly moves tooling toward their next phase of growth



Procrastinators Beware
Impact Reporting is due December 9th, and Retro Funding will be based on performance of the work completed to that point. Make sure to scope your proposal to complete within the time window. Less is more. 



Application Process
Decide what pool to apply for funding (you can only select one)

Draft a proposal on the Greenpill Dev Guild Proposal Page

Submit final proposal on Gardens platform (cannot be edited once submitted)

Wait to grow enough conviction from the Evaluation Council for your proposal to pass



Impact Reporting (More Details Soon)
To track progress and measure impact each proposal will require a Karma GAP project to report their activities and milestones. The round will utilize the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) framework for activity reporting which consists of deliverables and metrics.



The round consists of 4 CIDS activity report structures: 

Interoperability

Collaboration

UI/UX

Product Growth

Funding Paths


Pilot Pool $15,000
Smaller funding amounts to incubate innovative new, unproven ideas or small tooling builds with large impact.



Who's this Pool for?

New builders looking to dive into the Ethereum public goods space

Experienced builders with an innovative but unproven idea



Evaluation Process

Builders submit an initial draft of their proposal on the Greenpill Dev Guild Charmverse where the community can offer feedback

Builders then post their proposal on Gardens, where proposals are governed by an open community of Allo Patron NFT holders that opt into governance

Retro funding will be awarded based on the success of the project, as reviewed by the Round's Evaluation Council





How Funds Are Allocated

Proposals request the amount of funding needed to complete the work described

More funds requested = more Allo Patron conviction needed to pass

Proposals that reach the threshold of conviction are funded

Retro funding is distributed in December based on milestone completion and impact reporting



Create Pilot Proposal
Growth Pool $70,000
Larger funding amounts addressing known pain points in critical public goods infrastructure or maturing existing tools.



Who's this Pool for?

Experienced builders with an idea addressing a critical infrastructure need

Builders of existing public good tooling looking to become more interoperable



 Evaluation Process

Builders post an initial draft of their proposal on the Greenpill Dev Guild Charmverse where the community can offer feedback

Builders then post their proposal on Gardens, where proposals are governed by the Evaluation Council, a diverse group of builders and researchers with a strong pulse on public goods

Retro funding will be awarded based on the success of the project, as reviewed by the Round's Evaluation Council



How Funds Are Allocated

Proposals request the amount of funding needed to complete the work described

More funds requested = more Evaluation council conviction needed to pass

Proposals that reach the threshold of conviction are funded

Retro funding is distributed in December based on milestone completion and impact reporting





Create Growth Proposal


Retro Rewards $60,000
In order to qualify for retro a proposal must be made on Gardens by the October 31st deadline.

If you receive funding from the pilot or growth pool, you must complete your impact reporting and milestones to qualify for retro.

If you submit a proposal and don't get funding, you must follow the round impact reporting framework and complete milestones or show substantial progress/growth to qualify for retro.

Retro rewards will be determined in December and announced during the closing ceremony.
