## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 weeks)

### Ecoregion Frontend Integration
- [ ] Display ecoregion data in CrossAnalysisSummary (show which ecoregion(s) the polygon overlaps)
- [ ] Add ecoregion-based analysis option alongside country-based analysis
- [ ] Create UI toggle to choose between country vs ecoregion analysis mode
- [ ] Show ecoregion metadata (name, biome, realm) in analysis results
- [ ] Test ecoregion-based queries with various polygons
- [ ] Add ecoregion boundary visualization on map (optional enhancement)

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Document new `/api/geospatial/analyze-plot` cross-analysis response format in API.md
- [ ] Document all 7 ecoregion endpoints in API.md
- [ ] Add examples of cross-analysis responses to PUBLIC_API_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Update README with new analysis features

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Add indexes on countries_native and countries_introduced columns for faster analysis
- [ ] Optimize cross-analysis query performance with proper indexing strategy
- [ ] Monitor query performance with larger polygon analyses
- [ ] Complete remaining 3% of ecoregion tile assignments (171k tiles)

---

## ðŸ”§ Infrastructure & Performance

### Backend Enhancements
- [ ] Create helper functions for country name mapping and normalization
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed country polygon intersections
- [ ] Implement query result caching for repeated analysis requests
- [ ] Add request rate limiting for analysis endpoints

### Monitoring & Performance
- [ ] Set up query performance monitoring for spatial analyses
- [ ] Add logging for cross-analysis usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during large polygon analyses
- [ ] Track most common analysis polygons and cache results

---

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Enhancement Options

### Advanced Cross-Analysis Features
- [ ] Multi-country polygon analysis (species crossing borders)
- [ ] Temporal analysis capabilities (species changes over time)
- [ ] Biodiversity metrics calculation (Shannon diversity, Simpson index)
- [ ] Species co-occurrence and community composition analysis
- [ ] Elevation-based analysis using terrain data
- [ ] Climate zone cross-referencing

### Data Enrichment
- [ ] Integrate climate data for species-environment correlations
- [ ] Add elevation data for elevation range analysis in polygons
- [ ] Consider IUCN Red List integration for conservation status analysis
- [ ] Explore trait data integration for functional diversity analysis

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Export as GeoJSON (species locations with metadata)
- [ ] Export as JSON (full analysis results)
- [ ] Analysis history and saved polygon management
- [ ] Comparison tools for multiple polygon analyses
- [ ] Interactive data visualization beyond basic species lists (D3.js charts?)
- [ ] Share analysis via unique URL

---

## ðŸ§  Knowledge Graph Integration Exploration

### Apache Jena/Fuseki Evaluation
- [ ] Assess current Blazegraph instance vs Fuseki capabilities for species data
- [ ] Research SPARQL query patterns for advanced species relationships
- [ ] Evaluate RDF data modeling for taxonomic hierarchies and ecological relationships
- [ ] Test semantic query capabilities with sample species data

### Graph Database Integration Planning
- [ ] Compare query capabilities: PostGIS spatial + semantic graphs vs pure relational
- [ ] Identify use cases where graph queries would enhance user experience
- [ ] Plan data modeling: species-ecosystem-location-taxonomy relationships in RDF
- [ ] Consider hybrid approach: PostGIS for spatial, graph for semantic relationships

### Advanced Query Capabilities Assessment
- [ ] Research complex ecological queries (food webs, habitat dependencies, co-occurrence)
- [ ] Evaluate SPARQL federation for linking external biodiversity databases
- [ ] Assess inference capabilities for taxonomic reasoning and ecological relationships
- [ ] Compare performance: graph queries vs complex SQL JOINs for multi-hop relationships

## ðŸ”„ Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for cross-analysis edge cases
- [ ] Write tests for native status analysis functionality
- [ ] Write tests for ecoregion endpoints
- [ ] Clean up temporary scripts in `/scripts/research/`

- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Data Quality
- [ ] Investigate remaining 171k tiles without ecoregion assignments (oceanic areas?)
- [ ] Verify country name matching accuracy in cross-analysis
- [ ] Audit intact forest data coverage
- [ ] Review commercial species flagging logic
